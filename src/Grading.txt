Good work!  Your program is very clean and works well.

For future projects, you will want to start adding comments.
Everybody does comments slightly differently, but anything that
would have helped show structure or break up the verses would
make the code easier to read and maintain in the future.

There is one efficiency that could be added.  Notice that
every time you call AteMalt(), you call ThatJackBuilt() immediately
afterwards.  Therefore, you could add ThatJackBuilt() at the end of
your AteMalt() method, and remove it from the verse methods.  Then,
you could do the same thing with KilledRat() (add AteMalt() at the
end of it), etc.  Your MilkedCow() function, then, would be your last
line, and it would automatically call the rest of the methods for the
last verse.
